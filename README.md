# Lilith # 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This project focuses on refactoring an existing website to improve its accessibility and adhere to industry standards. The goal is to ensure that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies. The project involves modifying the codebase to meet specific accessibility criteria, optimizing CSS efficiency, checking and fixing broken links, and organizing the code for long-term sustainability. The codebase will be enhanced with comments explaining each major element or section of the page. This project showcases the importance of web accessibility and demonstrates the ability to refactor code for better accessibility and maintainability.
